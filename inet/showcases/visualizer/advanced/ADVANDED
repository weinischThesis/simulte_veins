need a configuration that has multiple visualizers
probably some visualization using arrows

the main point here, is that if you cant do something with just one visualizer, you can use more

like you want to visualize TCP packets with red

and UDP packets with blue

need something that cannot be done with just one visualizer -> its important.



integrated

there is the integrated visualizer. it contains an integratedcanvasvisualizer and an integratedosgvisualizer
each contain all the visualizer types, just the ones for 2d and 3d.

and there is the XYVisualizer, which contains the XYcanvasvisualizer
and the XYosgvisualizer

so there is only one integrated

and a lof of canvas and osg

integrated visualizer is integrated in the sense that it has both canvas and osg visualizers

integratedcanvasvisualizer is integrated in the sense that it has all kinds of visualizers
the same for integratedosgvisualizer



so need to find something that cannot be done with a single visualizer

like one of them visualizes this the other that. 

not good enough

what kind of visualizers there are

ideas:

- UDP and TCP traffic, from different nodes
- transmitter towers with propagating signal visualization and receiver nodes with reception indication -> nope.
or maybe.
- statistic visualizer -> currently it can display one statistic. so display different statistics for different nodes.

these can be combined

available filters in networkroutevisualizer: nodeFilter, packetFilter, lineColor

-> one type of packet this color other type of packet that color

different colored packets and different statistics

draft:

- About the Integrated
- Its possible to set the parameters from the GUI
- The config -> can have multiple visualizers

should be called multiple visualizers ?
